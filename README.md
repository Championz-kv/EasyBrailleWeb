We Bring to you this app so you can easily connect with those who are visually impaired.

EasyBraille is a cool web app that helps bridge the gap between sighted folks and those who are visually impaired by translating text to braille and vice versa. It has two main features:

To Braille Translator: You can input text, and it converts it into braille. It even supports multiple languages, translating them into English first before converting to braille. You can copy the braille for printing too.

From Braille Translator: You can input braille characters manually or paste them if you have a softcopy. It converts these into English text or other languages, as long as the braille is in English.
